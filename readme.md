# Bookings and Reservations

This is the repository for my bookings and reservations project.
Made while taking Trevor Sawlers [Go Web App Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/)

- Built in Go Version 1.22.2
- Uses the [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/v5)
- Uses [alex edwards SCS session management](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2)
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)

- Still a decent amount of work left if I want to finish this. Mainly tests that are lacking and some styling and such. Think some of my migrations are not working 100% either.
